% Batch generate STFs by applying synthetic RGC cone pooling models (derived 
%   by fitting center/surround pooled  weighted cone mosaic responses to 
%   diffraction-limited DF/F STF measurements - see runBatchFit()) to cone 
%   mosaic responses obtained under physiological optics. 
%   Then fit the generated STFs using a DoG model and generate figures with 
%   key parameters of the DoG model (Figs 10 and 11 of the paper).
